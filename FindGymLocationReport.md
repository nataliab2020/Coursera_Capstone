## Introduction: Business Problem <a name="introduction"></a>

In this project we will try to find an optimal location for a fitness studio. 
Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an **Gym / Fitness Club** in **Toronto (North York)**, Ontario.  
Since there are lots of Gym studios in North York we will try to detect **locations that are not already crowded with Gyms**. We are also particularly interested in **areas with no Gyms in vicinity**. We would also prefer locations **as close to city center as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met, since it will have better access using public transportation.

We will use our data science powers to generate a few most promising neighborhoods based on this criteria.  
Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.
